**Sam Nolan** (pseudonym: Hazelfire) Sam is an independent researcher creating the [Pedant](https://hazelfire.github.io/pedant/#/) language under an EA Infrastructure grant (see recent [post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xue4yQ5rn6iDsHdmM/pedant-a-type-checker-for-cost-effectiveness-analysis)).

**Taimur Abdaal**, from Causal&#x20;

**David Reinstein**: My background... Economics academic, UC Berkeley, research/teaching in UK 15 years, now at Rethink Priorities, an empirically-driven think tank associated with EA. Side projects including (funded) 'EA market testing team'. [web cv](https://daaronr.github.io/markdown-cv/)



**Also consulting or in discussion:**&#x20;

We are in conversation with **James Snowden** (GiveWell), who expressed some interest, but he does not see this as a top priority for GiveWell.

**Lukas** @ Causal\
**Ozzie Gooen** (Guesstimate, Squiggle)

**Pete Wilderford**, co-CEO of Givewell\
Others at RP and GPI (esp, David Rhys-Bernard?) who have done MonteCarlo CEAs



We could consider more about great ways to illustrate this and build up this skill that a lot of people want to learn. [Michael Hewlitt](https://cea.app.swapcard.com/event/eagxboston/person/RXZlbnRQZW9wbGVfMTM5NDcxNTE=) is interested in building this up. Pete Wilderford,  CEO at Rethink is also a strong advocate of this approach. And we've had conversations with Taimur Abdal of [Causal.app](https://causal.app) (and the 'not overthinking' podcast/youtube), who was very interested in facilitating this analysis within his app ... which has seed funding from FTX' Sam Bankman-Fried... so the circle all comes together&#x20;
